'''Experts have told the BBC that the current Covid surge in China is "unlikely" to impact India, but they urged people to stay cautious and wear masks.

India has stepped up surveillance after a spike in cases in neighbouring China.

People travelling from China and four other Asian countries now have to produce a Covid-19 negative test report before entering India.

On Tuesday, drills were held to check if hospitals could handle a surge.

According to government data, India currently has only around 3,400 active coronavirus cases. But reports of the surge in China and the memories of two deadly Covid waves in 2020 and 2021 in India have made many people fearful.''']
